# It's Just a Minor Thing - Keeping Up with the Red Hot Chili Peppers

Learning to play the guitar is filled with many small moments of awe: the first time you comprehend the hieroglyphics of the fretboard, the feeling when you finally match up lyrics to a strumming pattern, or, my favorite, the moment you learn a new riff from a famous song, and fully comprehend the brilliance and talent behind the guitarist who created it.
The first time I learned the riff to the song Snow, for instance, I had an entirely new appreciation for John Frusciante, the lead guitarist behind the Red Hot Chili Peppers. And as I work towards getting these famous notes (which altogether may not be more than 5 seconds long) to sound even close to recognizable at 60% speed, I gain a new appreciation for our favorite funk metal hooligans.
What may give others a similar admiration is a deep dive into the data behind the band’s style of playing. The Red Hot Chili Peppers released 11 albums from the years 1984 to 2016, with a new one on the way later this year. Pulling data from the Spotify Web API, I started by exploring the quartiles of tempo among all 108 of the band’s songs.
